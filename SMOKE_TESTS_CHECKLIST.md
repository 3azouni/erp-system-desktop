echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV
echo $APP_TIMEZONE

# Run build test
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### **Database Check**
```sql
-- Check if events table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
    WHERE table_name = 'events'
);

-- Check recent events
SELECT type, entity, created_at 
FROM events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Storage Check**
```bash
# Check if storage buckets exist (via Supabase dashboard)
# product-assets bucket should exist
# barcodes folder should be accessible
```
